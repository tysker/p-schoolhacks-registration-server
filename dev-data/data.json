    "description": "An insightful workshop on Angular presented by Flemming and Johannes from Nes Tech! At Nes Tech, we believe in the power of Angular to revolutionize web development. Flemming and Johannes, experts from Nes Tech's UI team, will share their passion for Angular and why it's essential for developers to explore its capabilities.\n\nFlemming shares, \"We are a small Danish company where the UI team is passionate about Angular and think it's a shame that developers don't know about it, but simply choose React as the default. This without having heard of Angular. My colleague and I would really like to change that by reaching out and telling a little about Angular.\"\n\nNo prior knowledge of Angular required! If you have any JavaScript experience and have the latest version of Node.js installed, bring your laptop if you want to code along. Otherwise, just turn up to watch and learn and expand your understanding of Angular.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity to delve into the world of Angular and enhance your JavaScript skills!",

    "description": "Our guest speaker is Ole Tange. He has worked in IT since 1992 as a network manager, programmer, security specialist and site reliability engineer. Today he is an IT policy advisor at PROSA.\n\nAs you know, artificial intelligence has made quantum leaps in recent years. You've probably heard of ChatGPT. But there are other AI tools as well: Image, audio, video and code generation, to name just a few of the possibilities that have opened up.\n\nThese possibilities and explorations can be overwhelming for newcomers. However, it is crucial to recognise and address the limitations and social risks while actively working to prevent negative consequences. This is precisely why we have chosen the following subject:\n\nAI Tools: New opportunities and threats you didn't know about a year ago.\n\nSince AI is a very broad topic, Ole has narrowed down his presentation to focus on specific topics. Those topics are as follows:\n\n1. AI progress: Recent progress and ChatGPT\n\n2. exploring the versatile toolbox of AI: images, audio, video and code.\n\n3. the limits of AI and societal concerns\n\n4. mitigating the adverse effects of AI.",

    "title": "Docker Workshop",
    "description": "This workshop on Docker is being presented by Sofus, a consultant and trainer from Praqma, a company that specializes in DevOps and Agile practices. Sofus will be introducing the basics of Docker, a platform for creating, deploying, and running applications in containers, to the computer science students attending the workshop.\n\nSo what is Docker?\n\nDocker is a platform that allows you to build, deploy, and run applications in containers. Containers are a lightweight, portable way to package and isolate applications and their dependencies. With Docker, you can easily move applications between development, test and production environments and ensure they run consistently across platforms.\n\nOne of the main benefits of Docker is that it makes it easier to manage dependencies between different parts of your application. For example, if your application relies on a particular version of a library, you can containerize that library along with your application to ensure that it runs correctly even if the library is updated or changed in other parts of the system.\n\nIn this workshop, we will cover the basics of Docker, including:\n\nCreating and running containers\n\nCreating and running images\n\nManaging containers with Docker Compose\n\nNetworking and storage in Docker\n\nWhether you're a beginner or already have experience with Docker, this workshop will give you a solid foundation of the technology and help you use it in your own projects.\n\nHope to see you there!",
